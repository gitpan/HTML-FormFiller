HTML-FormFiller version 0.04
=============================

DESCRIPTION

Quite often when working with user input from HTML forms it is useful to be
able to show the same form again with fields repopulated with the information
previously provided by the user.

MOTIVATION

Although there's already a module in existance to pre-populate forms when
running under CGI (HTML::FillInForm) it requires a CGI object to work.

This module implements the same idea but without the dependency on
CGI/mod_perl. Simply pass in the HTML and the hash of form field data and let
the module do the rest.

SYNOPSIS

First you need some HTML markup ($html), preferably with form fields in it.
You also need a hash-reference ($form_field_data) containing form field data in
a 'fieldname' => 'fieldvalue' format.

Assuming you have form fields called first_name, last_name and email, you
should then populate your hash as follows:

 $form_field_data = {
   'first_name' => 'John',
   'last_name'  => 'Smith',
   'email'      => 'johnsmith@hotmail.com',
 }

You would incorporate this into a script similar to the following:

 use HTML::FormFiller;

 # lots of code

 # prefill form fields
 $filled = HTML::FormFiller->fill($html, $form_field_data);

 # send the output to the browser
 print "Content-type: text/html\n\n";
 print $filled;

INSTALLATION
